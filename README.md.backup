## About The Project
Ecology is important in the modern world. Recognizing this, the European Union requires companies to disclose their environmental impact, including carbon emissions. 
This study project presents a tool for a fictional ecological consultant firm. The tool has two key components:
* The carbon footprint calculator that allows clients to input data, calculates their company's emissions, and provides recommendations for reduction.
* The summary report that aggregates data across all of the companies and shows major trends
